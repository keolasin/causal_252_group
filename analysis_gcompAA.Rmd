## Research Question

Existing studies find that infants born at low birth weight (LBW) are at an increased risk of physical disabilities and impaired cognitive development. While genetic factors contribute to LBW, maternal smoking during pregnancy has been identified as the most significant modifiable risk factor. We seek to answer the following question: what is the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the likelihood of having a LBW infant?

The target population for this study is live singleton first births in the US in 2015. We are limiting the population to singleton first births because multiples are associated with lower birth weight, and infants from subsequent pregnancies have been shown to have higher birth weights than those from first pregnancies.


## Target Causal Parameter

We aim to estimate the causal risk difference:
$\Psi^* (P^*) = P^* (Y1 - 1) - P^* (Y0 - 1)$ 
$= E^*(Y1) - E^*(Y0)$

The target causal parameter is the difference in the counterfactual risk of LBW if all expectant mothers in the population smoked during pregnancy vs. if all expectant mothers in the population did not smoke during pregnancy.

## Data Set

First, we import the data set for 2015 and inspect it, including variables available.

```{r import-data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# data set guide: https://data.nber.org/lbid/docs/LinkCO89Guide.pdf
# raw data files:
## download, unzip, and place in data folder:
## http://www.nber.org/lbid/1989/linkco1989us_den.csv.zip
## http://www.nber.org/lbid/1990/linkco1990us_den.csv.zip
## http://www.nber.org/lbid/1991/linkco1991us_den.csv.zip

here()
df <- read_csv("/Users/alexadia/Documents/GitHub/causal_252_group/sample_5percent.csv", col_names = TRUE)
vars <- names(df)

vars
```

Next, we select variables of interest for our analysis by subsetting from the larger data set.

### Variables included in the dataset are as follows:
```{r select-vars, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# subset the data to variables of interest
df_tobacco <- df %>%
  select(
    # W1 variables
    mrace15, mhisp_r, # race/ethnicity info
    mager9, # mother's age group
    dmar, # marital status
    meduc, # highest education level obtained of mother
    wic, # mother recipient of WIC
    mhtr, # mother height
    bmi, # mother bmi
    rf_pdiab, # pre-pregnancy diabetes (mother)
    rf_phype, # pre-pregnancy hypertension
    recare, # month prenatal care began
    # W2 variables
    wtgain, # mother weight gain during gestation
    rf_gdiab, # gestational diabetes
    ip_gon, ip_syph, ip_chlam, ip_hepb, ip_hepc, # infectious diseases present at birth
    # W3 variables
    oegest_comb, # weeks of gestation (17-47)
    dwgt_r, # mothers weight at time of birth
    sex, # sex of infant assigned at birth
    # Exposure variables
    cig0_r, cig1_r, cig2_r, cig3_r, # smoking status during each trimester
    # Outcome variables
    bwtr4, # outcome variable (infant birth weight)
    # subsetting/filtering variables
    tbo_rec, # birth order of infant
    illb_r, ilop_r, ilp_r # time since last live birth, last other pregnancy, last pregnancy
  )

```

### Data Cleaning

Then, we recode some of the variables of interest into outcome and exposure variables A and Y. We also prepare the covariates and endogenous variables for analysis by recoding them into indicator or dummy variables. We also remove missings or unknowns, which is a very conservative analysis approach - future analysis may utilize data imputation, but given the large number of records in this data set and the relatively small number of missing/unknown data, for the purpose of this assignment the more conservative approach is taken.

```{r recode-variables, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Removing unknowns/missings
df_noMissing <- df_tobacco %>%
  filter(
    bwtr4 != 4, # remove unknown birth weights

### Summary statistics of variables for analysis in the dataset

To better understand the data we're working with and get a sense for the distributions across variables (W1,W2, W3, A, Y), we can observe the information presented in Table 1 below.

```{r table1}
head(df_firstBorns)

summary_prep <- df_firstBorns %>%
  select(-illb_r, -ilop_r, -ilp_r)
summary_prep[,1:6] <- sapply(summary_prep[,1:6], as.factor)
summary_prep[,9:11] <- sapply(summary_prep[,9:11], as.factor)
summary_prep[,13:18] <- sapply(summary_prep[,13:18], as.factor)
summary_prep[,21:24] <- sapply(summary_prep[,21:24], as.factor)

summary_stats <- summarizor(summary_prep, by = "smoked", overall_label = "Overall")
summary_stats <- as_flextable(summary_stats, spread_first_col = TRUE, separate_with = "variable")
summary_stats <- labelizor(
  x = summary_stats,
  part = "header",
  labels = c(
    "0" = "No Smoking (A=0)", 
    "1" = "Smoked (A=1)"
  )
)

summary_stats <- labelizor(

  )
)

summary_stats <- labelizor(x = summary_stats, part = "header", labels = stringr::str_to_title)

save_as_docx(

save_as_image(summary_stats, path = here("tables/table1.png"))

```

```{r collinearity}

# install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)

corr_matrix <- df_firstBorns %>%
  select(-illb_r, -ilop_r, -ilp_r, -sex) %>%
  cor()

corrplot(corr_matrix, method = "number", order = "hclust", title = "Collinearity Matrix of Variables", bg ="white")

# lbw ~ oegest_comb,    -0.60
# dwgt_r ~ bmi,          0.84
# mager9 ~ wic,         -0.43
# mager9 ~ meduc,        

# we should keep bmi over dwgt_r, dwgt_r has less of an association to outcome (lbw) than bmi.

# arbitrary high correlation considered to be greater than 0.7 to 1 (or -0.7 to -1)
correlation <- as.data.frame(corr_matrix)
high_correlation <- correlation %>%
  filter_all(any_vars((0.5 < . & . < 1) | (-1 < . & . < -0.5)))
```

We should keep bmi over dwgt_r, dwgt_r has less of an association to outcome (lbw) than bmi.

```{r main-terms-model}

model1 <- glm(lbw ~ ., family = "binomial", data = df_firstBorns)
summary(model1)

```

The dataset consists of a number of variables describing births and pregnancies in the United States in the year 2015 with `r n` records after removing missing values, obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics.

### Marginal Distributions of Exposure and Outcome

For the mothers smoking status during the pregnancy, we observe:
`r smoke_marg`

For the low birth weight status at time of birth (outcome), we observe:
`r lbw_marg`

## Expected Challenges

Anticipated challenges include:

Identifying singleton births - we may need to create a unique identifier for each mother 
Computational strain given the size of the data 
Remaining potential for uncontrolled confounding (e.g., genetics, traumatic experiences during pregnancy)

## Expected Deviations

Potentially measuring only singleton births (single live birth per delivery) or even first live births from that mother.

## Analysis

### Sampling from Target Population

```{r sample}

sample_size <- n*0.05 # sample 5% of the larger dataframe, n = number of records in df

df_5percent <- sample(df_firstBorns, sample_size)

```

### G-Comp
```{r g-comp}
#Step 1: Estimation using regular model - note: i'm using df given I am loading up the 5% CSV
model1 <- glm(lbw ~ ., family = "binomial", data = df)
summary(model1)

#Step 2: Copy the original dataset into two new DFs: exposed and unexposed
exposed<-unexposed<-df
#Set smoked=1 in exposed and smoked=0 in unexposed
exposed$smoked<-1
unexposed$smoked<-0

#Step 3: Using the original model, predict outcome for each individual in the sample under the exposure
predictY.exposed<-predict(model1, newdata=exposed, type='response')

#Step 4: Using the original model, predict outcome for each individual in the sample under no exposure
predictY.unexposed<-predict(model1, newdata=unexposed, type='response')

# Step 5. take the mean of difference in the predicted outcomes to average over the distribution of the covariates - NOTE- do we have to change this based on the binary outcome?
mean(predictY.exposed - predictY.unexposed)
```

### IPW
```{r IPW}
#2. Estimate the epxosure mechanism P(A|W)
IPWdata<-df%>%select(-lbw)
prob.AW.reg<-glm(smoked~., family="binomial", data=IPWdata)

# 3. # predicted probability of smoking, given baseline characteristics
prob.1W <- predict(prob.AW.reg, type= "response")

# predicted probability of not smoking, given baseline characteristics
prob.0W <- 1 - prob.1W

#4. Distribution of predicted probabilities
summary(prob.1W)
summary(prob.0W)

# 5. Create the weights
wt1 <- as.numeric(df$smoked==1)/prob.1W
wt0 <- as.numeric(df$smoked==0)/prob.0W
#check weights
summary(wt1) # one adult is being upweighted by 5113
summary(wt0)

# 6. Point estimate:
iptw <- mean(wt1*df$lbw) - mean( wt0*df$lbw)
iptw

# 7. Stabilized IPTW estimator - Modified Horvitz-Thompson estimator
iptw.st <- sum(wt1*df$lbw)/sum(wt1) - sum(wt0*df$lbw)/sum(wt0)
iptw.st
```
